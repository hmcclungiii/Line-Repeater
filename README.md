# Line-Repeater
Frequently I have to copy and paste several lines, several times.  For example, say I had to copy the following, repeating each line three times:

This is the first line.
This is the second line.
This is the third line.

The end result of my copy/pasting would be:

This is the first line.
This is the first line.
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
This is the second line.
This is the second line.
This is the third line.
This is the third line.
This is the third line.

Such a simple example, yes, but imagine if there are hundreds of lines!

I started to make macros in the applications that are used during this process, but ended up just opening #develop and coding a quick app for it real quick.
